This research is part of the research unit [FOR 2895](https://www.for2895.uni-stuttgart.de/) on **Unsteady flow and interaction phenomena at High Speed Stall conditions**.
We introduces an alternative strategy to solve the [optimized DMD](https://doi.org/10.1137/M1124176) problem.
The optimization relies on backpropagation and gradient descent.
The approach is very robust to noise, allows incorporating [physical constraints](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2022.0576) or [regularization](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4863670), and mitigates overfitting by following machine learning best practices.

## Results sneak peek

The figure below shows a sequence of vorticity snapshots taken from the laminar flow past a cylinder. The snapshots are heavily corrupted by noise. The noise is scaled by the absolute value of the vorticity and a scaling factor $\gamma$.

The figure below presents the first five eigenvalues (sorting by mode amplitude) computed with exact DMD, optimized DMD solved by variable projection (varPro), and optimized DMD solved with backpropagation/gradient descent (ADAM/POD). Each box has a width of 0.01. The black reference circles mark the eigenvalues obtained with exact DMD on the clean data. The ADAM/POD approach captures all eigenvalues accurately for the full range of investigated noise levels.

## Repository structures and dependencies

The new algorithm is tested on three different datasets. Each analysis is contained in a dedicated Jupyter notebook:

- [1d_example.ipynb](https://github.com/AndreWeiner/optDMD/blob/main/1d_example.ipynb): toy problem with known dynamics; corresponds to example 2 in [Askham and Kutz](https://doi.org/10.1137/M1124176)
- [cylinder.ipynb](https://github.com/AndreWeiner/optDMD/blob/main/cylinder.ipynb): laminar flow past a circular cylinder at $Re=100$; classical benchmark case
- [swept_wing.ipynb](https://github.com/AndreWeiner/optDMD/blob/main/swept_wing.ipynb): pressure sensitive paint measurements of transonic shock buffet on a swept wing

The DMD analyses rely on two packages, PyDMD and flowTorch. [PyDMD](https://github.com/PyDMD/PyDMD) implements the optimized DMD based on variable projection. To install PyDMD, run:
```
pip3 install pydmd
```
The new algorithm and the exact DMD are implemented in [flowTorch](https://github.com/FlowModelingControl/flowtorch). Currently, the new algorithm is only available on the development branch. To install the development version, run:
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/FlowModelingControl/flowtorch.git@aweiner
```

The snapshots of the cylinder flow are part of the flowTorch dataset collection; refer to the [installation instructions](https://github.com/FlowModelingControl/flowtorch#getting-started). The shock buffet data is proprietary and cannot be shared easily. To get access to the data, please contact one of the authors.
